# To fix our search bar i pass into mobile-menu container
* First to input placeholder i pass q name, that will add GET parameter and send home page

# To update topics page first i need to add new view.py for this and url.py
* I define q method in view for topicsPage and if user searches that q method will be send to topicsPage
* And in the home function inside views.py i specify that only 5 first topics are visible 

# Then i make More button actually a link, which will be browse topics bar
