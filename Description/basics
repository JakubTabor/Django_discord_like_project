# First i gonna create in terminal base application typing python manage.py startapp base and it add the folder inside our directory
* And now to let know the django about these app, so to connect it i go settings.py
* Inside installed_apps i add base.apps.BaseConfig, it will gonna go to base folder, then to apps.py and to BaseConfing class

# Next i gonna create 2 url files using function, one for root url and one for app
* I create functions with request object, which will be http object
* It tell what kind of request method is send, what kind of data is being passed in, what user is sending to backend
* From there we are gonna return simple http response, so i import HttpResponse
* Next i go the the url-s and specify if someone goes into home page, we are gonna send that user to home
* Home page is empty string, which means that's just query url

# Then we create another function for one more page, which is room
* Inside the path we need to set parameters, which are first route path('room/', room), room- the function that we want to call
