# First thing that we are gonna build will be sidebar, which are gonna cointain all topict, Next i gonna build search bar
* I start from make a styling to our website

# I start from creating topic object and render that in home page
* I loop through all the topics, in each iteration creating whrapper
* And add link by topic name, its gonna be the filter
* I also specify all, which is gonna send user to the home page
* In views.py home function, i specify q as get method, q will be whatever we pass into the url
* Next in the rooms i gonna get topic, with query upword to the parent (__name=q)
* To work properly we need to create the condition, for now we dont have any parameters
* We are gonna check if the request method has something 
* And (icontains) make sure that whatever va;ue we had in the topic__name at least contain whats in here
* So if we type just (Py instead of Python), it will see that is contain at least these 2 letters
* And it will run the filter from the rooms parameter and return positive match

# Now to create search bar we go to navbar.html and text will be the input field
