# We are gonna use django rest framework
* First i create api folder and inside __init__.py, urls.py and views.py
* Inside views.py i import JsonResponse, because i want to response with json data when someone goes to the url
* Then i create view which shows us all routs in our api
* api/rooms will give us Json array of objects of all the rooms in our database
* And api/rooms/:id will give us single object and information about that rooms

# Then we take this python list of strings and put inside JsonResponse
* Parameter safe=False means that we can use more that just python dictionary inside of these Json response
* So it allow the list to turned into a Json list 

# Next inside studybud urls.py in let know that every url that start with api send to our api file
* And our urls.py in api folder will handle that  
* Then i import django framework and add it to settings.py in installed apps

# Now i gonna build urls based on django rest framework
