# We are gonna use django rest framework
* First i create api folder and inside __init__.py, urls.py and views.py
* Inside views.py i import JsonResponse, because i want to response with json data when someone goes to the url
* Then i create view which shows us all routs in our api
* api/rooms will give us Json array of objects of all the rooms in our database
* And api/rooms/:id will give us single object and information about that rooms

# Then we take this python list of strings and put inside JsonResponse
