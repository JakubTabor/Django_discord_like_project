# In this section i gonna download and edit the styling for the page
* Inside the home page i gonna include feed_component, topics_component and activity_component 
* I also extend main.html and change all default values to flexible format
* Por example {{message.create|timesince}} ago instead of hardcode 5 days ago
* I also change count for users and their usernames

# In views.py i create object for topics
* Method Topic.objects.get_or_create, it will return either an object or return object and create it
* If it cant find the object it will create it

# So in createRoom i rewrite the create function, including the topic
