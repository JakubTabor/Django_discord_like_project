# Next i gonna create authentication, user login, logout form, user registration
* First session will be created in the database and store in browser
* On each request it will be send to backend and check is these user allow to be here and what permissions do they have
* Session id is stored inside cookies in browser, we are gonna build these by ourselfs
* I create template registration and pass login form with 2 fields, username and password
* And then in views.py i create views for the login page
* Next in urls.py i create url for these and we render the ling inside navigation bar

# Now when we send this information we need to extract this values
* In views.py LoginPage i specify that when user enter his informations we are gonna get username and password
* These will be send from frontend, once we get these values we make sure that these user exist using (try, except)
* In exception (user doesnt exist) we want to throw error message, for this i import messages
* And we output the flash message, when we have any messages in the template we are gonna output all messages
* I bring it to main template
