# Now what we want to do is to set up real database in sql database
* We want to query database and render data from the database
* A lot of apps (different parts of our application) in our project have database section
* We have couple tables that are ready to be migrated
* Por example user table, for authentication is build table to store session id
* These are migrations created by django, which are sql commands ready to be executed
* They are gonna build out the tables which are inside installed apps
* To run these e need to type (python manage.py migrate)

# We are gonna create tables inside models.py using classes 
* Every single attribute inside python class will represent a column inside database ex. title, id, description

# So first in models we are gonna create some tables
* One is gonna be for our room, its gonna be class Room, inside will be host, so the actual user
* There will be also character field and description, which is text field
* And value null, if it is set to false the database cannot have an instance of the model without these value have something in it
* Another parameter will be blank set to true and these means that when we run save method it can be also empty
