# Now what we want to do is to set up real database in sql database
* We want to query database and render data from the database
* A lot of apps (different parts of our application) in our project have database section
* We have couple tables that are ready to be migrated
* Por example user table, for authentication is build table to store session id
* These are migrations created by django, which are sql commands ready to be executed
* They are gonna build out the tables which are inside installed apps
* To run these e need to type (python manage.py migrate)

# We are gonna create tables inside models.py using classes
