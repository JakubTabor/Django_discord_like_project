# Next i create view for rooms, but Room object is python list of objects
* Because objects cannot be converted automatically
* So i make serializers, which will be classes that take model that we want to serialize and turn it into Json data

# I import ModelSerializer and put it inside the class Roomserializer
* It will take all fields from Room model and convert that into  Json object
* And inside views.py i pass to getRooms the RoomSerializer and put inside object that we want to serialize 
* And parameter many, that stands if that are multiply object that we want to serialize
* Then we want to return data attribute of serializer object

# Next i gonna install django-cors-headers and add to installed apps and also to middleware
* And now using these we can specify which urls is allowed
* I gonna set it in setting.py to allow all origins

# This is how we can use api call to share informations
