# CRUD stands for (create, read, update, delete)
* First we are gonna create form for a room in templates
* Next i specify form for a method of sending data (POST method)
* If i don't specify the action it's gonna send to current url (action="")
* And i specify csrf_token, these token will be send on every form submit
* Because when we send post request in django we need to pass in these token
* It make sure that there is no malicious attempts
* Then i add also submit button, text will be uppercase and type lowercase
