# CRUD stands for (create, read, update, delete)
* First we are gonna create form for a room in templates
* Next i specify form for a method of sending data (POST method)
* If i don't specify the action it's gonna send to current url (action="")
* And i specify csrf_token, these token will be send on every form submit
