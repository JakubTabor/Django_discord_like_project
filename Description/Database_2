# Next i gonna create string representation of these room
* When we add a model to the database first thing we need to do is to make migrations
* It gonna be file with sql commands, we type python manage.py makemigrations

# Now when we have admin panel and we want to add room table
* To do these we go to admin.py and import our model (Room) and register these model with the admin panel
* We type admin.site.register(Room) - inside model that we want to register
* Now rooms appears on the site and we can add room, by its name and description
* When we got them created we want to render them inside of the list and view the details

# Next i import in views.py from models.py Room, so we import model that we want to query
* Next we take care of model manager, it is (object) and we specify what we want to get from it
* I type all() and it will give all rooms in the database
* Now inside our room function in views.py and assign the specific room
* Room - model object, models manager (objects) and we do get() to get one single item
* We are gonna get it by its uniqe valu, which is id=pk (primary key)

# And each rooms should have some categories
* First each room has its own message
* It will be the user which is sending the message, then room, which is gonna take parent class
* And i specify (CASCADE) that when the room will be delited, all (childrens) messages also will be delited
