# I start from creating directory in prompt using command django-admin startproject customusermodel
* And add to installed apps in setting.py base directory 
* Now in base models.py i import AbstractUser and pass it to User class
* To let know django, that i gonna use AbstractUser model i set in setting.py variable AUTH_USER_MODEL
* And point it to base directory and User class model
* Then i make migrations and add all default tables that migrated are added to sqlite database

# To make user uploaded content work out we go to setting.py 
* And make MEDIA_ROOT, it tell django where to upload these user profile pictures
* It gonna tell django where the pictures gonna go, so i set media root to  base directory
* And then we tell django to go to static file and store these images in images

# And i also specify media url and point to images
* Now i need to configure the root directory, so i go to urls.py in studybud and add filepath to this urls
* And also i gonna append url in the urlpatterns and set filepath to MEDIA_URL, which is /images/
* So i will get file from MEDIA_ROOT, which is	static/images in base directory
* And we connect MEDIA_ROOT to MEDIA_URL
